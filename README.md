# Atrium Client

This was my first ever java project that im no longer working on. I actually started making this for fun when i didn't
even have any knowledge about java. I'm making this project public because why not and also I will probably start working
on "Atrium Legit Base" after I will have bigger java knowledge. (Il might make some changes) <br />

Sry if i forgot something
