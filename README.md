# Atrium-Phobos-Edition
This was my first ever java project that im no longer working on. I actually started making this for fun when i didnt even had any knowlage about java. Im making this project public because why not and also i will probably start working on "Atrium Legit Base" after i will had bigger java knowlage. (Il might make some changes)
